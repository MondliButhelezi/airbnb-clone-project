# Airbnb Clone Project

## 🏁 Project Overview
This project is a backend clone of Airbnb. It simulates a real-world booking platform where users can list, book, and review properties. The project is built to mirror production-level development practices, including API creation, database design, and CI/CD integration.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Develop a robust backend system for a property booking platform
- Implement user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments
- Use modern tools and best practices in backend development

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Django** – Python web framework for building the backend
- **Django REST Framework** – For RESTful API development
- **GraphQL** – Flexible querying of backend data
- **MySQL** – Relational database for storing project data
- **Docker** – Containerized development and deployment
- **GitHub Actions** – Continuous integration and testing

## 👥 Team Roles

This project simulates a collaborative development team structure. Each role is critical in building, testing, and deploying a scalable Airbnb-like backend platform.
